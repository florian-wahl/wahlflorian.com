## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The build process automatically generates a sitemap via the `postbuild` script.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variable to enable Google Analytics:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=<your-google-analytics-id>
```

### Data Management

All personal data (experience, articles, talks, social links) is centralized in `constants/data.ts` for easy maintenance and updates.

### Blogging

Hosted blog posts are written as markdown files in `posts/` and served at `/articles/[slug]`. Add a new `.md` file with `title`, `date`, `description`, and `coverImage` frontmatter — it's automatically included in the feed and sitemap on the next build.
